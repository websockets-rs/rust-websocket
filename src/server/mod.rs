/// Synchronous implementations of a websocket server are available below, each method is
/// documented so the reader knows whether is it synchronous or asynchronous.
///
/// To use the synchronous implementation, you must have the `sync` feature enabled
/// (it is enabled by default).
/// To use the synchronous SSL implementation, you must have the `sync-ssl` feature enabled
/// (it is enabled by default).
///
/// # Asynchronous Servers
/// Asynchronous implementations of a websocket server are available below, each method is
/// documented so the reader knows whether is it synchronous or asynchronous.
/// Simply look out for the implementation of `Server` whose methods only return `Future`s
/// (it is also written in the docs if the method is async).
///
/// To use the asynchronous implementation, you must have the `async` feature enabled
/// (it is enabled by default).
/// To use the asynchronous SSL implementation, you must have the `async-ssl` feature enabled
/// (it is enabled by default).

/// This crates comes with hyper integration out of the box, you can create a hyper
/// server and serve websocket and HTTP **on the same port!**
/// check out the docs over at `websocket::server::upgrade::sync::HyperRequest` for an example.
///
/// # A Custom Server
/// So you don't want to use any of our server implementations? That's O.K.
/// All it takes is implementing the `IntoWs` trait for your server's streams,
/// then calling `.into_ws()` on them.
/// check out the docs over at `websocket::server::upgrade::sync` for more.
